## 1.Ask

### Business Task
Cyclistic wants to increase the number of annual members. To do this, we need to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. The goal is to provide actionable insights to support a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

### How can the insights drive business decisions?
By identifying the behavioral patterns, preferences, and usage trends of both casual riders and annual members, the marketing team can:

* Create campaigns tailored to casual riders’ habits.
*	Emphasize the benefits of membership based on actual usage data.

### Stakeholders
* **Lilly Moreno** (Director of Marketing);
* **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team**;
* **Cyclistic Executive Team**.

## 2. Prepare

### Data Source
Public trip data from [Divvy Bikes](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) (a real-world bike-share program managed by Motivate International Inc.). For this case study, the data is used to represent the fictional company Cyclistic.

### Data Summary 
* **Time Period**: June 2024 - June 2025 (12 months)
* **Format**: 12 CSV files (one per month)
* **Average Volume**: ~500,000 rows/month

### Key Variables
*	**ride_id** (unique trip identifier);
*	**rideable_type** (type of bike: classic, electric, or docked);
*	**started_at** and **ended_at** (start/end times);
*	**start_station_name**, **end_station_name**;
*	**start_lat**, **start_lng**, **end_lat**, **end_lng** (coordinates);
*	**member_casual** (user type: member or casual). 

### Data Preparation 

1. Downloaded the 12 CSV files; 
2. Made copies of the originals;
3. Renamed and organized the copies in a dedicated project folders.

### Initial Assessment
Performed spot checks in Excel for:

* Consistent file structures
* Missing value patterns

---

## 3. Process

### Tools Used
* **RStudio** (tidyverse, lubridate, dplyr, readr, knitr, ggplot2)
* **Microsoft Excel** (initial data review)

---

### Data Preparation
**Step 1**: Load required packages

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

**Step 2**: Import each data file:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
divvy_trip_data <- read.csv("")
```

---

### Data Cleaning

**Step 3**: Handled missing data - removed NA values with:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
[complete.cases()]
```

---

### Data Transformation

**Step 4**: Combined all 12, now cleaned, data frames using data frame list: 

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
df_list <- list(cleaned_divvy_data)
Divvy_tripdata <- bind_rows(df_list)
```

**Step 5**: Save  the combined data

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
write_csv(Divvy_tripdata, "Divvy_tripdata.csv")
```

**Step 6**: Calculate ride length (in minutes)

Convert timestamps to POSIXct, then create ride_length and filter out outliers (rides <1 minute and > 24 hours):

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Divvy_tripdata <- Divvy_tripdata %>%
  mutate(
    started_at = as.POSIXct(started_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
    ended_at = as.POSIXct(ended_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
    ride_length = as.numeric(difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins"))) %>%
  filter(ride_length > 1 & ride_length < 1440)
```

**Step 7**: Created "**day_of_week**":
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mutate(day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = FALSE, abbr = TRUE))
```

**Step 8**: Created "**day_type**" (Weekday/Weekend)
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mutate(day_type = case_when(
    day_of_week %in% c("нед", "съб") ~ "Weekend",
    TRUE ~ "Weekday"
```

**Step 9**: Created "**month & season**":
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mutate(month = month(started_at, label = TRUE),
         season = case_when(
           month(started_at) %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ "Winter",
           month(started_at) %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "Spring",
           month(started_at) %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "Summer",
           month(started_at) %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "Autumn"))
```

## 5. Share

### Key Question Answered
*How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclystic bikes differently?* 

### Summary:
* **Casual Riders**: Leisure-oriented, prefer weekends, long rides, tourist locations
* **Members**: Commute-focused, ride more during weekdays and rush hours, prefer business district stations

### Vizualizations

#### Ride Frequency and Duration

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Total Rides.png)

**Insight**: Members significantly outnumber casual riders in total trips, highlighting their consistent usage. 


---

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Average Ride Length.png)

**Surprise**: Casual riders’ average ride length is nearly double that of members, reinforcing the idea for leisurely use.


---

#### Time-Based Usage Patterns

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Bike Usage 24h.png)

**Insight**: Members show clear peaks during rush hours (7–9 and 16–18), aligning with work commutes. Casual rides are more evenly distributed, with slight peaks on the afternoon.


---

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Rides per Week.png)

**Insight**: Overall rides spike on weekends (especially Saturdays) by both groups.


---

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Avg Ride Lengdth Week.png)

**Insight**: Again it shouwcases Casual riders’ trips being consistently longer than members’, with both groups riding slightly longer on weekends.


---

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Total Rides in Week.png)

**Insight**: Showcases the weekly trend for total rides, and confirms the alredy established trend. 


---

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Total Rides in Week Zoomout.png)

**Insight**:  A broader view confirms that while weekend spikes are noticeable, the overall ride increase is not drastic. 


---

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Seasonality.png)

***Insight***: Seasonal patterns align with expectations—higher ridership in warmer months and lower in the colder ones. 


---

#### Bike Type Preferences

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Casual Bike Use.png)

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Member Bike Use.png)

**Insight**: Both groups prefer classic bikes (~60%), but casual riders use electric bikes slightly more (38% vs. 35% for members). Dockless scooters are negligible for both.


---

#### Most Popular Start Stations

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Stations Casuals.png)

**Insight**: Casual riders frequent tourist-heavy areas (e.g., Streeter Dr & Grand Ave near Navy Pier).


---

![](E:/Divvy Trips Data/CSV/Stations Members.png)

**Insight**: Members prioritize stations near business districts (e.g., Kingsbury St & Kinzie St in the West Loop).


---

## 6. Act

### Strategic Recommendations
* **Weekend Memberships**: Introduce an "Unlimited Weekends" pass
* **Seasonal Campaigns**: Offer summer deals and winter loyalty perks
* **Commuter Conversion**: Target casuals with frequent weekday use

# Final Reflections

This Cyclistic case study was my first hands-on project after completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate. It helped me apply what I learned — especially data cleaning, transformation, and visualization — to a real-world business problem.

Working with real data had its challenges, like missing values and inconsistent formats, but it also showed the importance of staying organized and following a clear process. I analyzed patterns in user behavior, such as seasonal trends, and turned those insights into simple, practical recommendations.

This project is my starting point in building a strong data portfolio. The steps I followed — asking the right questions, preparing and analyzing the data, and sharing insights — will guide my future work in analytics.
